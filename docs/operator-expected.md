# Operator Expected — the live "what only aytek can do" checklist

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Status | LIVE — updated at every session close (operator request, Session 10) |
| Last updated | 2026-07-10 (Session 13 close: E3.3 COMPLETE — entry-point matrix live; NEW §7 device matrix is your half of the acceptance) |
| Rule for agents | Update this file at session end alongside `resume-prompt.md`. It is TRACKED (in `docs/`) so the operator can read it anywhere on the go. The untracked root `OPERATOR-TODO.md` is now just a pointer here. |

Nothing below blocks the next session (E4.2 — zero-shame copy gate). Items are
ordered by how much they age; check a box by replacing `[ ]` with `[x]` and the next
session's agent will prune completed items.

> **Session 13 outcome (2026-07-10):** E3.3 is DONE — per-quit intent parameter
> (entity/query over the pre-cache), TRUE per-source attribution (the
> `.lockscreenWidget` hardcode is dead), the discreet **"Reset"** control, and the
> in-app panic entry. **Billed runs used: 2** (red evidence → green, zero burned —
> the docs-check + typecheck-harness gates paid off). One platform ceiling was
> RECORDED (not a bug): iOS cannot tell Control Center / lock-screen slot / Action
> button apart for one control, so control launches attribute `.controlCenter` —
> details in §7 below, veto path noted there.

## 1. E0.3 panic-latency device measurement — carried since Session 02, load-bearing

- [ ] Run the harness in `docs/spike-panic-latency.md` on an **iPhone 15-class
      physical device** with full Xcode; record the numbers in that doc (~30 min).
      It is the ONLY remaining blocker on wiring E3's permanent latency CI gate —
      and since Session 10 it measures the REAL panic flow's first frame.
- [ ] With the numbers, settle the wording drift: MVP §7 "<2 s, 10/10" vs
      test-suite §1.5 "p90 < 2.0 s" (one-line edit to the losing doc).
- [ ] While on the device (optional, ~5 min): feel-pass the 4-7-8 haptic rhythm in
      the real panic flow — input for E5's haptics-only settings work.

## 2. Try E4.1 on your device (your ask, Session 12) — ~10 min

- [ ] **From Xcode (Mac26 + iOS26 device):** open the project, edit the Unhooked
      scheme's Run environment variables, add `FORCE_PANIC_ROUTE=1` and
      `UITEST_SEED_PANIC_SNAPSHOT=1`, run on the device. You should see: the
      seeded two-quit picker → the real ~90s panic flow (4-7-8 breath bloom with
      haptics, urge timer, your seeded motivations verbatim, redirect menu) →
      exits → **"I slipped" → the NEW two-tap slip flow**: "Log a slip?" →
      "Log it" → the forgiveness screen ("Logged." + best/momentum framing, the
      calm NEUTRAL undo banner) → tap Undo within 10 minutes → "Undone. Your
      streak is right where it was."
- [ ] A plain TestFlight launch still shows the walking-skeleton root: no
      quiz/onboarding exists yet to create quits, so the new dashboard slip entry
      has nothing to list. That arrives with E5.

## 3. Content tone review — now fully TestFlight-visible

- [ ] `panicScript.json` ships since Session 10; **`slipCopy.json` ships since
      Session 12** — every string in the slip flow renders from it. Review both
      files' tone against the brand kit voice.
- [ ] **The ONE new agent-drafted line (Session 12):** `slipCopy.json`
      `confirm.retryNote` — *"That didn't save just yet — nothing's lost. Tap Log
      it to try again whenever you're ready."* Shown only when the durable write
      fails; must stay calm, zero-shame, retryable (`REVIEW.md` item 3).
- [ ] Pre-ship (unchanged): clinician/legal pass on `safetyCopy.json`; verify the
      flagged helplines; TR L10n review (`App/Resources/Content/REVIEW.md`).

## 4. GitHub Actions billing headroom — ~2 min per session

- [ ] Session 13 used **2** billed macOS runs (red → green, none burned); Session 14
      (E4.2) plans **2** (red evidence → green; the copy gate adds no goldens). Check
      Settings → Billing → spending limit before the session.
- [ ] Optional, would eliminate the burned-run class entirely: a cheap self-hosted
      macOS runner or a pre-push `xcodebuild -quiet build` step.

## 5. TestFlight housekeeping — carried from Sessions 07–09

- [ ] Add internal testers (nobody receives builds until a tester group exists —
      the panic **and slip** flows are now genuinely worth testing).
- [ ] Expire the stray bundle-version-"1" build; answer export compliance only if
      App Store Connect prompts.

## 6. Slack webhook rotation — optional hygiene, ~5 min

- [ ] CI reads `secrets.SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL`; the old URL briefly sat in local git
      history. Rotate when convenient.

## 7. E3.3 manual device matrix — YOUR half of the E3.3 acceptance (~15 min)

The build half shipped Session 13; the acceptance's device matrix is operator-owned
device work. Any post-E3.3 build works; for seeded quits run from Xcode with scheme
env `UITEST_SEED_PANIC_SNAPSHOT=1` (two-quit pre-cache: "Vaping" + one discreet).

- [ ] **Place the surfaces** from the system galleries: the "Streak" lock-screen
      widget (its wind button); the **"Panic"** control in a lock-screen control
      slot AND in Control Center; Settings → Action Button → Controls → "Panic".
- [ ] **Discreet check:** in the controls gallery, confirm the **"Reset"** control
      shows the neutral counterclockwise-arrow glyph and its description ("Opens a
      quick reset.") carries zero habit words; place it once and fire it.
- [ ] **Run the matrix** — each row × Focus ON and OFF; at least one pass in
      airplane mode (Epic 3 DoD: zero network dependency):

      | # | Launch from | Expect | Recorded source |
      |---|---|---|---|
      | 1 | Lock-screen widget button | picker (2 quits) → flow | lockscreenWidget |
      | 2 | Lock-screen control slot | same | controlCenter (see note) |
      | 3 | Control Center "Panic" | same | controlCenter |
      | 4 | Action button | same | controlCenter (see note) |
      | 5 | "Reset" control (any surface) | same | controlCenter (see note) |
      | 6 | In-app "Panic" button on the root | picker sheet | inApp |

- [ ] The attribution VALUES are unit-pinned, so if row-by-row source inspection is
      friction, it is enough to confirm each surface OPENS the flow (Focus on/off,
      airplane ok) — that closes the matrix. To spot-check a recorded source, finish
      one flow arm ("The urge passed") and inspect the persisted UrgeEvent from an
      Xcode run.

> **Platform note (recorded adjustment, not a bug):** iOS provides NO API to tell
> Control Center vs lock-screen slot vs Action button apart — one control
> registration serves all three and YOU assign placement. Rows 2/4/5 recording
> `controlCenter` is correct behavior. `.actionButton` stays reserved in the schema.

## Decisions on record you can veto (FYI, no action needed)

- **Discreet quits keep VERBATIM motivations in the pre-cache** (labels stay
  stripped) — Session 10 ruling. Veto before E5.2 if you want discreet
  motivations minimized instead.
- **A completed store-route undo DELETES the Slip row** (Session 11, shipped
  Session 12) — an undone slip never counts against Reduce allowance or insights;
  its CloudKit tombstoning is a named §4.3-flip design item.
- **The cold slip flow writes ONLY the outcome buffer** (single-writer pre-cache
  pin, Session 11) — repeat-cold-slip display honesty comes from the in-memory
  draft fold, never a second writer to `panic-snapshot.json`.
- **Redirect menu ships the JSON's 4 options** (ratified override, not drift).
- **E3.3 attribution ceiling (Session 13, recorded adjustment):** control-family
  launches (Control Center / lock-screen slot / Action button) all record
  `.controlCenter` — iOS has no launch-surface API for controls (docs-checked,
  WWDC24 10157). `.actionButton` stays reserved in the schema. Veto path: a new
  dedicated `PanicSource` case for the "Reset" control would need a schema
  decision, not a platform fight.
- **Shortcuts exposure (Session 13):** the lock-screen widget intent ("Panic")
  remains Shortcuts-discoverable (pre-E3.3 behavior); a Shortcuts-run launch
  attributes `.lockscreenWidget` exactly as the old hardcode did. The control
  intent is NOT discoverable (the discreet "Reset" control rides it — a Shortcuts
  row titled "Panic" would leak what it hides).
