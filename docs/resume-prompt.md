# Resume Prompt: Unhooked — The Quit-Anything Streak Widget

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Document | Resume Prompt v1.7 |
| Last updated | 2026-07-09 (E2.1 CI-verified; TestFlight bootstrap 2 of 3 fixed — signing mapping carried) |

## ✅ Step 0 RESOLVED (billing + E2.1) · ⚙️ carried: TestFlight signing fix (small, agent work)

Billing fixed 2026-07-09; **run 28979808466 attempt 3 verified everything on HEAD
(1d21da3): all test lanes green** — commit H's three E2.1 store tests, the Ballast
sweep, release-gate floors. **E2.1 is DONE and CI-verified.**

**TestFlight bootstrap — 2 of 3 failures fixed, third carried (agent work, ~1–2
commits, do it FIRST next session):** clone-404 fixed (repo renamed to
`aytekXR/ballast-match-certs`), PAT grant fixed by operator (verified push:true).
Attempt 6 then got through match (distribution cert minted) but **gym archive fails**:
`No profiles for 'com.beyondkaira.ballast'/'.widgets' were found … Automatic signing
is disabled and unable to generate a profile`. Root cause: the Fastfile never maps the
`match AppStore com.beyondkaira.ballast(.widgets)` profiles onto the targets —
project.yml is `CODE_SIGN_STYLE: Automatic` and CI has no Xcode-managed account. Fix in
`fastlane/Fastfile`: after match, force manual signing for the archive (e.g.
`update_code_signing_settings(use_automatic_signing: false, team_id, code_sign_identity:
"Apple Distribution", profile_name: ENV["sigh_com.beyondkaira.ballast_appstore_profile-name"])`
per target — widget too — plus gym `export_options.provisioningProfiles` mapping).
Then rerun the upload lane. Notes: `MATCH_BOOTSTRAP=true` stays set until the first
green upload, THEN delete it; attempt 6's cert push never landed in the certs repo
(sole commit predates the runs), so the portal may hold a distribution cert whose key
is lost — match will mint a second (Apple allows two) or the stale one needs revoking;
hygiene (operator call): the certs repo contains the raw ASC `AuthKey_QL8L4UKHW5.p8` —
recommend removing it (it lives in the GitHub secret + operator mirror).

## Where we are

**Epic 1 is closed**: `Packages/StreakEngine` is tagged **streakengine-v1.0.0**
(annotated, on af5b969) with 63/63 tests green and llvm-cov 100% regions/functions/
lines; the E1 edge-case suite is a **named merge-blocking CI release gate**
(`Release gate · StreakEngine edge-case suite`, Linux, mechanical floors: lines ≥98%
package-wide, regions ≥95% on StreakCalculator.swift + SlipTransition.swift; TestFlight
lane `needs` it). The adversarial portfolio API review (architecture §14) landed six
verified findings — headline: the input type is now **`StreakSnapshot`** (renamed from
QuitSnapshot pre-tag; internal params `quit`→`snapshot`), `StreakEngine.version ==
"1.0.0"` (test-pinned both sides), platform floor iOS 18/macOS 15, and the public `///`
surface is consumer-self-contained. Ratified semantics live in Sessions 03–05 "Key
decisions" in `past-prompts.md` — read them before touching the engine.

**E2.1 (single SwiftData store in the App Group) is DONE**: commit G (09b3a90) red
CI-verified (run 28975932867, three canonical failures), commit H (ae4d34f) green
**CI-verified** (run 28979808466 attempt 3, on HEAD 1d21da3). The store: five §3 models
(CloudKit-checklist-clean, no `.unique`, everything defaulted/optional),
`PersistentStore` factory at `<App Group>/Library/Application Support/unhooked.store`
(the App Group now resolves to `group.com.beyondkaira.ballast.shared`),
**`cloudKitDatabase: .none` today. Gate G0 is now CLEARED (2026-07-08), so the CloudKit
flip to container `iCloud.com.beyondkaira.ballast` is UNBLOCKED** — do it red-test-first
per test-suite §4.3 when a session takes it on.

## Carried technical items (do not lose)

1. **Reboot high-side sanity cap (ADR-7 gap, since Session 03) — THIS session's E2.2 is
   where it lands:** the repository provides the persisted last-known-good wall reading
   the cap needs. Red test first: reboot + huge forward wall jump must NOT read
   `.normal`/inflate. `undoSlip` inherits the same fallback (pinned by test).
2. E2.1 acceptance items open by design: protection-class complete-until-first-unlock
   (device tier), §4.3 CloudKit-option instantiation (Gate G0), widget read-only open
   (device/E6). §4 indexes (`isArchived+sortIndex`, `at`, `isPendingUndo`) deferred to
   E2.2 — add them WITH the queries that justify them.
3. `StreakCalculating` doesn't expose sanityCheck/applySlip/undoSlip/adherence —
   deferred to first consumer need (protocol-extension defaults). E2.2's repository is
   likely that first consumer — if so, expose via defaults, red-first, non-breaking.
4. `StreakSnapshot` synthesized Codable requires the `bestStreakSeconds` key — decide
   the payload-compat story when persistence makes it real (repository/migration).

## Operator-owned blockers (not agent work; carry until closed)

1. ~~**GitHub Actions billing**~~ — ✅ **CLEARED 2026-07-09**; CI fully operational (verified live).
   Follow-on: **`MATCH_GIT_URL` PAT needs Contents read/write on `ballast-match-certs`**
   (see Step 0) — the only thing between here and the first TestFlight build; does NOT
   block E2.2.
2. ~~**Gate G0 rename**~~ — ✅ **CLEARED 2026-07-08.** Name **Ballast**, org **`com.beyondkaira`**;
   registered `com.beyondkaira.ballast`, `.widgets`, `group.com.beyondkaira.ballast.shared`,
   `iCloud.com.beyondkaira.ballast`; Team ID `UH7MXG7Z94`. Sweep done in `project.yml`
   (bundle IDs, App-Group entitlements, display names → "Ballast", `DEVELOPMENT_TEAM`) +
   `Shared/Sources/AppIdentifiers.swift`. Unblocks TestFlight/ASC/marketing + the CloudKit flip.
3. **Phase 2 — App Store Connect + CI secrets** (PARTIAL): ASC app record + API key created
   (Key ID `QL8L4UKHW5`, Issuer `c7e2168e-…`); operator to confirm the 5 GitHub secrets
   (`ASC_API_KEY_P8_BASE64`, `ASC_KEY_ID`, `ASC_ISSUER_ID`, `MATCH_GIT_URL`, `MATCH_PASSWORD`)
   + the one-shot repo Variable `MATCH_BOOTSTRAP=true` are set on `aytekXR/unhooked-quit-widget`.
   Fastfile mints app+widget App Store profiles via match (repo `aytekXR/ballast-match-certs`).
   **First bootstrap TestFlight run is pending billing (#1); after the first green run, DELETE
   the `MATCH_BOOTSTRAP` variable** so CI stays read-only. Secrets stored operator-side in
   `~/ballast-secrets.md` (machine-local, not in repo).
4. **E0.3 device measurement** — still open; `docs/spike-panic-latency.md` on iPhone 15-class.
   Needs full Xcode (operator machine is Command-Line-Tools-only).
5. ~~**Content plan**~~ — ✅ **DRAFTED (agent) 2026-07-08**, `App/Resources/Content/`
   (`milestones.json` ×6 categories, `panicScript.json`, `slipCopy.json`, `safetyCopy.json`,
   `helplines.json` + `REVIEW.md`). Passes the local no-shame / no-medical-claims scan; **inert
   (not bundled, no `project.yml` ref, audit tests 12–13 not yet added)**. STILL OPEN before
   ship: clinician + legal sign-off on `safetyCopy.json`; 3 helpline verify-flags (TR ALO 182,
   YEDAM 115 hours, US CSB line); TR L10n pass. See `App/Resources/Content/REVIEW.md`.
6. **Drift decision:** MVP §7 "<2s 10/10" vs test-suite §1.5 "p90 < 2s".

## Next session objective (one session, definition of done below)

**E2.2 — QuitRepository** (`implementation-plan.md` E2.2, deps
E2.1 ✓ + E1.3 ✓), strictly test-first via the macOS CI lane (session-rules mechanics:
red evidence = the CI run on the red commit):

1. The implementation plan's named red tests: `test_logSlip_isSynchronous_noAwaitNoNetwork`
   (type-level + timing), `test_logSlip_persistsBeforeReturning`,
   `test_activeQuits_excludesArchived`, `test_createQuit_fourthActiveQuit_throwsLimitError`,
   `test_repositoryWrite_triggersDebouncedWidgetReload` (spy on a `WidgetRefreshing`
   protocol; single reload for a 3-write burst in 500ms).
2. **The carried ADR-7 reboot-cap red test** (item 1 above) — the repository persists
   the last-known-good wall reading and feeds the engine's guard; engine changes, if
   any, are red-first in the package with the coverage bar held (gate enforces it).
3. §4 indexes land here with their justifying queries; repository is the sole SwiftData
   importer outside trivial `@Query` lists (the E2.2 acceptance lint/grep CI check).

Scope guards: no UI, no paywall, no widget rendering; StreakEngine behavior changes
only red→green with 100% coverage held (the CI gate now enforces the floor
mechanically); never weaken a QA assertion; `logSlip` stays synchronous-local.

## Standing rules reminders (do not relearn these)

- No shame copy; no medical claims; no red anywhere in UI; discreet variants mandatory.
- Analytics via the closed `AnalyticsEvent` enum only; zero events before opt-in;
  `logSlip` stays synchronous-local.
- Monotonic fields (`bestStreakSeconds`, `totalCleanSeconds`) never decrease — undo is
  the ONE sanctioned exemption (§9 rule 3); streaks freeze, never inflate (ADR-7).
- Panic path stays thin (ADR-6). Single CloudKit-mirrored SwiftData store; no accounts,
  no backend (ADR-2). Gate G0 is CLEARED — the real IDs are `com.beyondkaira.ballast`
  (+`.widgets`); never re-introduce the `dev.placeholder.quitwidget` strings. Never
  weaken a QA assertion; TDD red first, always (test-suite §7).
- StreakEngine ratified semantics (Sessions 03–05): zero-tracked momentum = 1.0;
  boundary-inclusive milestones; cumulative clean numerators; momentum's denominator —
  and the slip instant — ride the guarded timeline; momentum unchanged in the same tick
  across a slip; one reversible slip at a time; whole-day adherence evaluation with
  half-open membership and re-anchored day boundaries; uptime readings must be
  sleep-inclusive monotonic; the input type is `StreakSnapshot` (no consumer-domain
  nouns in the package surface); package doc comments stay consumer-self-contained.
- E2.1 store rules: no `@Attribute(.unique)` ever (CloudKit checklist, mechanically
  tested); `cloudKitDatabase` is `.none` today, but Gate G0 is now CLEARED so the flip
  to `iCloud.com.beyondkaira.ballast` is UNBLOCKED — do it red-test-first (§4.3);
  `Date()`/`ProcessInfo` remain banned in production code.
